# 🌱 AI-Based Crop Disease Detection

## 📌 Overview
The **AI-Based Crop Disease Detection** system leverages machine learning and deep learning to identify crop diseases from images. This solution helps farmers and agricultural experts detect diseases early, enabling timely intervention and improved crop yield.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Image Upload & Processing** – Users can upload images of crops for disease analysis.
- ✅ **AI-Powered Detection** – Uses deep learning models to classify crop diseases.
- ✅ **Confidence Score** – Provides accuracy percentage for each prediction.
- ✅ **Disease Information** – Displays symptoms, causes, and treatment recommendations.
- ✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Designed with React.js and Tailwind CSS for seamless navigation.
- ✅ **Real-Time API Integration** – Uses a fast and scalable backend for quick results.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Machine Learning Model:** TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Cloud & Deployment:** AWS / Firebase
